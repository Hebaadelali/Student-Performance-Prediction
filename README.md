# Student Exam Score Prediction

**Description:** Machine learning project to predict students’ exam scores with data preprocessing, evaluation, and insights.

---

📌 **Project Overview**  
This project predicts students’ exam scores based on their study habits, attendance, and other features.  
The work is presented from two perspectives:  

- **Educational / Stakeholders:** Insights on key factors affecting exam performance.  
- **Technical / Data Science:** Preprocessing, handling missing values & outliers, feature encoding, model training & evaluation.  

---

⚙️ **Tech Stack**  
- Python 🐍  
- Pandas, NumPy  
- Scikit-learn  
- Matplotlib / Seaborn / Plotly  

---

🚀 **Steps**  

**Data Preprocessing**  
- Handling missing values  
- One Hot Encoding categorical variables  
- Detecting outliers with Z-score  

**Modeling**  
- Linear Regression  
- Train-test split & cross-validation  

**Evaluation**  
- R² Score, MAE, RMSE  
- Learning curves  
- Actual vs Predicted plots  

---

🔑 **Key Insights**  
- Attendance, study hours, and previous scores strongly influence exam performance.  
- Model predicts exam scores **very accurately** (R² ≈ 0.99, low error).
