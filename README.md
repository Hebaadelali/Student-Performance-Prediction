# Student Exam Score Prediction

**Description:** A machine learning project to predict students’ exam scores with data preprocessing, model evaluation, and insights.

---

## Project Overview
This project predicts students’ exam scores based on their study habits, attendance, and other relevant features.  
The work is presented from two perspectives:  

- **Educational / Stakeholders:** Provides insights on key factors affecting exam performance.  
- **Technical / Data Science:** Covers data preprocessing, handling missing values and outliers, feature encoding, model training, and evaluation.

## Tech Stack
- Python  
- Pandas, NumPy  
- Scikit-learn  
- Matplotlib, Seaborn, Plotly

## Project Steps

**Data Preprocessing**  
- Handling missing values  
- One Hot Encoding categorical variables  
- Detecting outliers using Z-score  

**Modeling**  
- Linear Regression  
- Train-test split and cross-validation  

**Evaluation**  
- R² Score, MAE, RMSE  
- Learning curves  
- Actual vs Predicted plots  

---

## Key Insights
- Attendance, study hours, and previous scores are the most influential factors on exam performance.  
- The model predicts exam scores with high accuracy (R² ≈ 0.99, low error).
